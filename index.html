            You are now the new owner of a <strong>Weber 22" Original Kettle Premium Charcoal Grill</strong> that will hopefully serve you faithfully for many years.
            <p>
            * Limited edition green!<br />
            * One touch cleaning!<br />
            * Built to last!<br />
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>This fine green grill reminds me of Grandpa Broeker and Arden Ave., and it should look just sporting up in the Bayfield woods. The accessories (of which there are many!) and charcoal are up to you. I would recommend a high quality wood lump charcoal :)</p>

        <p>Well, the old girl is down in my car as we speak and ready for Instant Pickup. If you are having doubts about said grill, I have the receipt and can easily return it for you in favor of another model or color.</p>
